                  Marine environment is risky but livelihood for millions in our
                  country. Fishermen and their boats could fall for an emergency
                  situation which may happen whenever due to sudden climatis
                  conditions. The solution we provide is identification of these
                  risky situations and alerting the fishermen as soon as
                  possible
                </p>
                <p>
                  So this is designed in a way that it could detect the risky
                  regions which could create difficult circumstances to
                  fishermen.There are many reasons and factors that could make
                  fisherman to suffer while fishing . Whenever the factors that
                  could create the difficult situations rise from their normal
                  to abnormal level there creates a probability that a fishermen
                  could engage in risk.
